## How it works: 
The home page of our website starts out with asking the user two questions: 
1) Where are you currently? 
2) Where are you planning to go? 

### There are **3 different paths** - each which leads to a detailed path on another page. 

The path includes: 
- a picture of google maps along with a route we have chosen. 
- the different bus stops and the buses that pass through that stop.
- a detailed description with landmarks so that our users don't get lost 
  - sometimes looking at a map is hard (as someone who is directionally challenged!). 

On the home page, there is also a button regarding the **blue lights**: 
Clicking that button leads the user to a page asking where the user is closest to (has all 10 colleges plus Mchenry). When the user selects their location, it takes them to a page that has a pictuer of the nearest blue lights. 

What we used: We used Figma and Google Maps, as well as siter.io to transform it into a site. We are looking into a domain name as well.
