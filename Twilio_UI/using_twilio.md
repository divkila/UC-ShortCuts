# Integrating Twilio

UC ShortCuts uses Twilio to communicate with its users to provide a better experience overall. Unfortunately, our team wasn't able to completely integrate Twilio due to us not being able to access paid services. Ideally, we would have Twilio function as a bot that provides our users with downloadable maps upon request and prompts the user to give their route a rating so it can be reccommended to others.

Below is an example image using the Twilio interface:
