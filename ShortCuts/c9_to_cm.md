Clicking on this shortcut leads the user to a map showing the shortcut. Since this is somewhat of a forest path - the description is extra detailed! 
We also included a warning since the route contains many steep hills. Like every one of our shortcuts, there is a button that allows users to recieve a 
downloadable map.
