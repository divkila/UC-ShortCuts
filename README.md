# UC-ShortCuts
Project Name: Our project is called UC - ShortCuts: the acronym is UCSC as it is specific to our UC campus in Santa Cruz. Similar names include UC Sexy Calves, etc. 
Project Motivation: Was created during CruzHacks 2023. When collaborating, we realized that google maps is often innacurrate and even at times suggests dangerous routes on our campus. Our campus has multiple beautiful paths and shortcuts but they take a while to learn. So, we decided to compile them and make them easy to access through a simple website. 
How it works: The home page of our website starts out with asking the user two questions: 1) where are you currently? and 2) Where are you planning to go?. 
There are 4 different options - each which leads to a detailed path on another page. The path includes a picture of google maps along with a route we have chosen. The map also highlights the different bus stops and the buses that pass through that stop. There is a also a detailed description with landmarks so that our users don't get lost - sometimes looking at a map is hard (as someone who is directionally challenged!). On the home page, there is also a button regarding the blue lights: clicking that button leads the user to a page asking where the user is closest to (has all 10 colleges plus Mchenry). When the user selects their location, it takes them to a page that has a pictuer of the nearest blue lights. 
What we used: We used Figma and Google Maps, as well as siter.io to transform it into a site. We are looking into a domain name as well.
