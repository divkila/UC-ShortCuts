Clicking on this shortcut leads the user to a page with the route drawn on google maps. There is also a detailed description since the route is quite long.
Alternate routes are mentioned since the route contains many uphills and can be quite strenuous. Also, there is a bus route reccomended for accessiblity 
purposes.
