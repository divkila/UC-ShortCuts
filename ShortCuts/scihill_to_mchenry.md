# Shortcut 1 - Science Hill to McHenry

## UI/UX

Clicking on the first shortcut route gives the user clear instructions and visuals on how to use the chosen path. For example, this path is harder to see as it's under the bridge leading to the Science & Engineering Library. This is why provide written instructions as well as a visual map for accesibility.
Like every one of our shortcuts, there is a button that allows users to recieve a 
downloadable map. There is a legend that includes bus stops and stairs for the map.
