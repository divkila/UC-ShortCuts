Clicking on this shortcut leads the user to a page with the route drawn on google maps. There is also a detailed description since the route is quite long.
Alternate routes are mentioned since the route contains many uphills and can be quite strenuous. Also, there is a bus route reccomended for accessiblity 
purposes. Like every one of our shortcuts, there is a button that allows users to recieve a 
downloadable map.
